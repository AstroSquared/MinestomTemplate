# MinestomTemplate

MinestomTemplate is a quickstart repo for making Minestom servers.

## Quickstart

This quickstart is for Intellij IDEA.

1. Using GitHub, create a repo from the template (public or private)
    * If you don't want GitHub to say `Generated from ...`, you can download as zip and make a new repo instead, then upload the files to your repo
2. In Intellij IDEA, use `Get from VCS` and select your new repo
3. Go to the `build.gradle` file and change `rootProject.name` to your project's name
    * Commit and push (optional)
4. Run Main.main() any way you want
5. Start developing!
    * The default port is 25565

## Features

* Commands (includes console-only stop command)
* Events (includes template PlayerLoginEvent)
* Configuration (includes server-ip and server-port)
* Starting the server (includes spigot start message for hosts)
